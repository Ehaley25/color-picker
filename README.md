I built a web app that uses https://www.thecolorapi.com to get the Hex value for the color the user selects.

The reason to build was me and a client were trying to get a shade of green, and at first, they told me “Light green", 
I provided them with the color "light green”, and it was too light, the regular green was too dark and so on.
So, I thought it would be time to get some experience fetching from an API to build something that I can use for years to come.
